# Cypress E2E Testing Project

This project contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for a web application using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, and [Mochawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome) as the test reporter.

## 🛠️ **Configuration**

### **Cypress Configuration (cypress.config.js)**
You can modify test configurations in the `cypress.config.js` file. Key settings include:
- Base URL
- Default timeouts
- Integration folder for test cases

### **Mochawesome Reporter**
The Mochawesome configuration is included in the `package.json`:
```json
"mocha": {
  "reporter": "mochawesome",
  "reporterOptions": {
    "reportDir": "cypress/reports",
    "overwrite": false,
    "html": true,
    "json": true
  }
}
```

## 🔍 **Test Reporting**

### **Viewing Mochawesome Reports**
1. After running tests, reports are generated in `cypress/reports/`.
2. Open the `mochawesome.html` file in your browser to view the detailed test results.

## ✅ **Best Practices**
- Use descriptive test names.
- Keep page objects simple and reusable.
- Utilize Cypress's built-in commands like `cy.intercept()` for mocking API calls.
- Organize test data in the `fixtures/` folder.
